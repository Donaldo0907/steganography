# Steganography

This project implements a simple steganography using some extensive Python libraries like CV2, numpy and PIL. The tkinter library is used for GUI.
The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties. Unlike cryptography, which conceals the contents of a secret message, steganography conceals the very fact that a message is communicated.

### Setup

pip install -r requirements.txt

- To run encryption part
python encrypt.py

- To run decryption part
python decrypt.py

It is just simple, but somewhat interesting work.
Thanks for your time.
